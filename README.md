# Dynamo

[Dynamo](https://dynamobim.org/) is a visual programming tool that allows you to automate design tasks when using [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) Software. Although it is a visual programming tool, where typical programming skills are not requerided, it also allows to use code blocks to code something specific, using programming languages such as Python, for example.

The current repository aims to share Dynamo scripts developed in a professional context with the main goal of design automation using Autodesk Software, such as AutoCAD and Civil 3D.
